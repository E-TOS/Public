Setup for Arduino serial connection for Python/Flask.

Install arduino code "Pyduino" first, then setup port in code pyduino.py line 11.

Test system, arduino with blink_pyduino.py, for system connection, before testing with analog_read_test.py.
When done testing, and it works, test flask with hello_flask_world.py.
When both arduino and flask test works, you can run pyduino_website.py

Arduino Uno: photoresistor + 10kOhm resistor, 1 LED+Resistor (220Ohm - 1kOhm), usb.
Python Requirements: Flask, Serial, request
